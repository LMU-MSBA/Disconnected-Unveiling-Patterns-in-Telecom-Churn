# Disconnected: Unveiling Patterns in Telecom Churn

### Project Description:

This project aims to assist Disney in addressing their customer churn rate problem within the telecom industry. By understanding churn patterns and identifying at-risk customers poised to leave by month's end, we seek to mitigate the negative impact of customer turnover. Inspired by a job post focused on subscription bundle analysis, we leverage our expertise in bundle analysis to unveil churn patterns in telecom services. Our approach includes deploying Descriptive and Diagnostic Analytics Dashboards, an Automated Data Pipeline, and a Predictive Model to predict future churn rates and pinpoint at-risk customers proactively.
